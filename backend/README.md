# Backend - Invoice Extraction API

Django REST Framework backend for AI-powered invoice extraction.

## Setup
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

### **Let Me Explain Why Just These Two Files First:**

- **`requirements.txt`**: Tells Python what packages we need. We start with minimal dependencies.
- **`README.md`**: Documents what this folder does. Shows professionalism.

### **Questions for YOU:**
1. Do you understand why we're starting with just these 2 files?
2. Can you explain what each package in requirements.txt will be used for?
3. Are both files created in the right location?

**Once you've created these 2 files and can explain their purpose, say "GO FORWARD" and we'll do the NEXT single step.**

No rushing! One step at a time until you're comfortable. üê¢
